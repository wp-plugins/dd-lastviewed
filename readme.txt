Just another DD widget. Shows the users recently viewed/visited posts,pages and or custom posttypes in a widget.

== Description ==

This plugin contains the lastViewed-widget. This widget displays the last visited posts or custom posttypes of your visitor. 

The widget is fully set. 

* Choose the types
* Set the maximum
* Set thumbnail on/off
* Set the excerpt length

The plugin sets a cookie that keeps track of the visited IDs. It uses jquery.cookie.js to make this possible. 

The widget looks for the cookie. So to activate the widget, the visitor has to go first to a single page of the selected posttypes to display the widget. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `dd-lastViewed` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Customize the widget

You can use [dd_lastviewed widget_id="12"] as shortcode to publish the widget inside a page or a post. Do not forget to use the correct id!
