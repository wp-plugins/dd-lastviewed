Just another last-viewed widget. To show de last visited posts and custom posttypes.

== Description ==

This plugin contains the lastViewed-widget. This widget displays the last visited posts or custom posttypes of your visitor. 

The widget is fully set. 

* Choose which posttypes should be shown
* Set the maximum
* Set thumbnail on/off
* Set the excerpt length

The plugin sets a cookie that keeps track of the visited IDs. It uses jquery.cookie.js to make this possible. 

EU: this is a functional cookie, so warning not required.

The widget looks for the cookie. So to activate the widget, the visitor has to go first to a single page of the selected posttypes to display the widget. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `lastViewed` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Customize the widget

You can use [dd_lastviewed widget_id="12"] as shortcode to publish the widget inside a page or a post. Do not forget to use the correct id!
