Just another last-viewed widget. To show de last visited posts and custom posttypes.

== Description ==

The widget is fully set. 

* Choose which posttypes should be shown
* Set the maximum
* Set thumbnail on/off
* Set the excerpt length

The plugin sets a cookie that keeps track of the visited IDs. It uses jquery.cookie.js to make this possible.
